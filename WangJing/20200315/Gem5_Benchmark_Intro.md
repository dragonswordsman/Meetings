# Benchmark
## PARSEC
### Introduction
The Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers (PARSEC) is a benchmark suite for studies of `Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs)`. PARSEC includes emerging applications in recognition, mining and synthesis (RMS) as well as systems applications which mimic large-scale multithreaded commercial programs.
### Details
#### Input Sets
Define six input sets for each benchmark : test, simdev, simsmall, simmedium, simlarge and native.
#### Workloads
`blackscholes` : calculates the prices for a portfolio of European options

`bodytrack` : computer vision algorithms

`canneal` :  minimize the routing cost of a chip design

`dedup` : compresses a data stream with a combination of global and local compression

`facesim` : models face by simulating the underlying physics

`ferret` :  content-based similarity search

`fluidanimate` : physics simulations for animations

`freqmine` : data mining techniques

`streamcluster` : the online clustering problem

`swaptions` : price a portfolio of swaptions

`vips` : the VASARI Image Processing System

`x264` : video encoder

### Command
Based on `FS` mode
```javascript
// generate the run script for the m5 simulator
// filename: blackscholes_64c_simsmall.rcS
#!/bin/sh
# File to run the blackscholes benchmark
cd /parsec/install/bin
/sbin/m5 dumpstats
/sbin/m5 resetstats
./blackscholes-work 16 /parsec/install/inputs/blackscholes/in_4K.txt /parsec/install/inputs/blackscholes/prices.txt
echo "Done :D"
/sbin/m5 exit
/sbin/m5 exit

// add the command line to run 
--script=blackscholes_64c_simsmall.rcS
```
### Simulation Result
The PARSEC hooks are a set of functions which are called at specific locations by the workloads of the PARSEC benchmark suite. It defines a Region-Of-Interest (ROI) which includes the computationally intensive, parallelized phase of the benchmark, but not the initialization or shutdown phase.

## SPEC2006
### Introduction
 The SPEC CPUÂ® 2006 benchmark is SPEC's (Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation) industry-standardized, `CPU-intensive` benchmark suite, stressing `a system's processor, memory subsystem and compiler`. SPEC designed this suite to provide a comparative measure of `compute-intensive performance` across the widest practical range of hardware using workloads developed from real user applications.
