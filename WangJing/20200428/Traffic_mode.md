## Introduction
A **TCG** is a directed graph $𝐺_𝑡=(𝑉,𝐸)$, where 𝑉 is the set of computation tasks, and 𝐸 is the set of communication channels between tasks. A task 𝑣 has a normalized execution time 𝑡. A directed edge $𝑒=(𝑣_𝑠,  𝑣_𝑑,  𝑤)$ has a source task $𝑣_𝑠$, a destination task $𝑣_𝑑$ and the amount of data 𝑤 that sends from $𝑣_𝑠$ to $𝑣_𝑑$.
